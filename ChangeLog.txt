Change Log

***************************************************************

v0.1.2
- The project now supports Hybrid-Modal logic instead of Modal logic.

- The following variants have been added:
	At
	Bind

- The following supporting classes have been added:
	Classes located at ca.ucalgary.ispia.rebac
		- Environment :- Provides a relationship between Variables and Values
		- Nomial :- Interface for the Nominal variant
		- Variable :- Represents a variable
	Classes located at ca.ucalgary.ispia.rebac
		- String_Constants :- A container for string constants
		- RandomEnum :- Randomized enumerator for assigning labels
		- Triple :- A generic relationship between 3 objects/values

- Tests:
	- The RelationIdentifier map created by GraphParser.java (under testClasses package)
	  is of type <Object, Object> instead of <String, Object>. Graph.java and the 
	  test classes have been updated to support that change.
***************************************************************

v0.0.3
- Updated toString methods for "Negation" and "Requestor"
  Negation.toString() now prints parenthesis around the returned string
  Requestor.toString() now returns "Requestor" (R is upper case)
  
- Updated CircleFrameTest.test() due to change in Requestor.toString().

- Changed classes representing varaints to interfaces, and moved the
  concrete classes to ca.ucalgary.ispia.rebac.impl
  Corresponding changes in ModelChecker.java and RebacPolicyParser
  
- Created class PolicyUtil that provices the translator method

- NOTE: RebacPolicyParser and PolicyUtil work with the concrete
        variant classes in ca.ucalgary.ispia.rebac.impl 

***************************************************************

v0.0.2
	
- Added test suite:
	- Added "resources" folder in src/test for resources to be used by JUnit testing.
	
	- In test section added "testClasses" package to hold basic testing classes.
	
	- Content of testClasses package:-
		- Edge :- Object to represent an edge in a graph.
		- Graph :- Object to represent a graph.
		- GraphPraser :- A SAX GraphML parser.
				NOTE: The GraphML parser depends on the GraphML file to be created through yEd.
		 			  This will need to be changed to work with generic GraphML files
		- Node :- Object to represent an node in a graph.
		- TestFrame :- A concrete frame implementation for testing.
		
	- Actual JUnit test cases in ca.ucalgary.ispia.rebac 
	
- Added ReBAC policy schema (rebacPolicy.xsd) in src/main/resources and in src/test/resources.

- Added ReBAC policy xml parser (rebacPolicyParser) in ca.ucalgary.ispia.rebac.parsers.

- Updated from JUnit 3.8.1 to 4.8.2

- Updated the assembly descriptor to include the ChangeLog.txt file.

- Added simple tests to test GraphML parser as well as ReBAC Policy parser.

- RelationshipIdentifier now known as RelationIdentifier

- RelationshipIdentifier interface removed, now Relation Identifiers are described by generic Object class.
